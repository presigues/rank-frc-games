# rank-frc-games

check out hows its doing here : https://66be3d5e832d57080ef489f2--melodic-conkies-24e79d.netlify.app

this project is a wip for a website that would let you be able to rank your favourite frc games. 

currently the website has a menu screen where you can click start to enter the game part of the website, and where you can click credits to be linked to my github. 

im still working on the rating part of the game, however clicking start shows the layout for how it works, and how it picked a game for you to rate.

even though the game isnt complete, i hope you enjoy checking out how it looks and what its soon to be!
